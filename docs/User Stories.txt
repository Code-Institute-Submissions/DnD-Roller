As a player I need to:

- Be able to roll dice for attack, damage and skill rolls.
- Be able to easily tell if my dice rolls are either the best or the worst.
- Be able to store my character's stats so I can easily return to it between sessions.
- Be able to send feedback back to the developer in case I need anything else readily available in my dice roller.
